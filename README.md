DSA Practice Code
This repository contains a collection of C++ code for practicing various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It is designed to help improve problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. The code includes different algorithms, sorting techniques, searching methods, and data structure implementations.

Features
Sorting Algorithms: Implementations of common sorting algorithms like Radix Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search, and other essential searching methods.
Hashing: Simple hash table implementation with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and search.
Graph Algorithms: Kruskal's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
Miscellaneous: Various data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.
Getting Started
To get started with the code, clone the repository using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone git clone [https://github.com/JavedTadavi/DSA-Practice-Code.git](https://github.com/JavedTadavi/DSA)
After cloning the repository, navigate to the folder and compile the C++ files using your preferred IDE or a C++ compiler.

Usage
You can test and run individual programs by providing the necessary inputs as prompted. The repository includes basic examples and explanations to help you understand each algorithm and data structure.
